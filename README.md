Extended TFTP Server Implementation

Description:
This project involves implementing the server-side of an extended TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) system using Java. The server supports multiple client connections, allowing users to upload, download, and delete files, as well as request directory listings. The communication between the server and clients is based on a binary protocol. The primary focus of the project is to practice concurrent programming, thread management, and synchronization techniques, using the Thread-Per-Client server pattern and handling bi-directional messaging.

Skills Required:

Programming Languages: Java
Concepts and Techniques: Concurrent programming, thread-per-client server pattern, synchronization, bi-directional messaging.
Tools and Libraries: Maven for build automation.
Development Practices: Implementing and managing multiple client connections, encoding and decoding binary data, ensuring thread safety and efficient communication.
